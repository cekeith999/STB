feat: Add target-aware quality assessment and mandatory quality checks

Enhances object creation workflow with comprehensive quality assessment
that checks if objects actually match the target (iPhone, car, cup, etc.)
and prevents finishing until quality thresholds are met.

Changes:
- Enhanced assess_object_quality() RPC method with target-specific checks
  - iPhone: requires body, screen, camera; checks for buttons, speaker, port
  - Car: requires body, 4 wheels; checks for windows, lights, spoiler
  - Cup/Mug: requires body, handle
  - Calculates target_match_score (0.0-1.0) based on required parts found
  - Combines technical quality (40%) + target match (60%) for overall score
- Added mandatory quality check before finishing
  - Automatically runs assessment when AI tries to finish
  - Requires quality_score >= 0.5 AND target_match_score >= 0.5
  - Forces AI to continue refining if quality is too low
  - Shows missing features and actionable guidance
- Enhanced system prompt with quality check requirements
  - Added "MANDATORY QUALITY CHECK BEFORE FINISHING" section
  - Instructs AI to check quality before finishing
  - Emphasizes object must match target before completion
- Improved assessment display
  - Shows both overall quality and target match scores
  - Lists found features and missing features separately
  - Provides actionable guidance based on scores

Why:
- User reported AI was creating basic primitives without checking if they
  looked like the target object (e.g., iPhone)
- Previous assessment only checked technical metrics (vertex count, modifiers)
- No validation that object actually matched the requested target
- AI could finish with incomplete objects that didn't resemble target

Safety:
- Backward compatible (assessment optional, only blocks finish if target provided)
- No network at import
- Lazy imports preserved
- Quality checks only run when target_object is provided
